Captain Coppercranium offers you a **sack with one hundred gold coins** for you duties.

But there's a catch. You have to **choose one sack out of ten**. Only one sack contains
the gold. All the other sacks just contain gilded lead coins.

The coins all look the same, but **a lead coin weights 10 gram** while **a gold coin
weights 11 gram**. 

**Your task is, to find the sack with the gold.**

Captain Ironbeard is no fiend. You will get a scale. You can weight one or more sacks
and you can take coins out of the sacks and weight them, too. The sack you choose does 
not need to contain all one hundred coins, but any missing coins is your personal loss.

**Good luck!**

And by the way: If you choose the wrong sack, Captain Coppercranium will cut you 
into tiny little pieces!
