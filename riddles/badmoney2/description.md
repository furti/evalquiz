After the last riddle Captain Coppercranium was left with 
a pile of coins: some gold ones, some lead ones.

<img class="float-right" src="riddles/badmoney2/coins.svg">

He used his scale to figure out the gold ones, but he was
a bit grumpy, because he couldn't cut anything into tiny 
little pieces. In fact, he was so very grumpy and angry,
that he smashed the scale against the wall, which left
at least the scale, as tiny little pieces.

After he settled a bit, he searched for the old pendulum 
balance scale from his grandmother.


## The riddle

Captain Coppercranium has **27 coins** left. One of these 
coins is **a gold one with 11 gram**, while all the others
are **gilded lead ones with 10 gram**. They all look exactly
the same.

He has an old pendulum balance scale, but without any
weights.

**Find the gold one with the least weightings.**

The `find(coins)` function is called repeatingly with it's
last result until it returns only one coin.
