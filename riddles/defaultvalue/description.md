Captain _Carrot Ironfoundersson_, Sergeant _Fred Colon_ and Corporal _Nobby Nobbs_ are 
members of the _Ankh-Morpork City Watch_. Today, they are checking the merchants 
at the _Trading Gate_. While Carrot is asking the merchants about their 
business, Fred is checking the carts and dictates Nobby the contents in order 
to write it down.

Write the failsafe `dictate(s)` function. The method either writes `s` or 
`"Nothing"`, if `s` is empty, `null` or `undefined`. Use the `write` method of the API to write
the list.
