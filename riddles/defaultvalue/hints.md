The `write` function is described at the API tab. 
Check it out, if you haven't done already.

This riddle has two basic purposes:

* you should get used to the interface
* you should learn something about JavaScript coding

Don't expect some dirty trick with this riddle.

To check for `null` you can use a simple condition:

    if (s === null) {
        ...
    }

In JavaScript `undefined` is not the same as `null` and `null` is not the same as 
an empty string (`""`).

In this riddle the function does not need to 
return a value.
