A long time ago a group of dwarfs was captured by a big dragon.

The dragon locked them in to a dark cave. But the dragon was not 
that hungry and he loved riddles a lot. So he gave them a task to 
solve. If they are able to solve the task they will be free to go. 
But if they fail the dragon will eat them all.

### The Riddle 

Each dwarf wears a hat - there are blue ones and read ones.

The dwarfs should leave the cave, one-by-one, and line up in a row.
_"All the dwarfs with a red hat shall stand on one side"_, the dragon shouts, 
_"and all the dwarfs with a blue hat shall stand on the other side"_.

Unfortunately the cave is so very dark, that no dwarf can see the color of
any hat. They do not remember, which hats they are carrying themselfs, and 
they are not allowed to talk (otherwise they will become an appetizer).

_Could you help the dwarfs to solve the task and save their lifes?_
