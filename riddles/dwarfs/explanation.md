The `join` function is called every time a dwarf leaves the cave.
The `hats` parameter holds an array with the colors of the hats
(as string `"red"` or `"blue"`) the dwarf sees in the line when 
he leaves the cave.

The function has to check the hats array and return the index at 
which the dwarf want's to join the line.
