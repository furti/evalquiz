The index is zero-based. That means you have to return `0` to
place a dwarf at the first position.

It makes no sense to change the order of the hats in the array - 
the dwarfs won't listen to this.

Don't try to carry a state from one function call to the next one. 
This is considered cheating and you will become an appetizer, too.

The array functions may help you. Check out the 
[documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
