Basically you have to perform the calculation and return the value by using the `return` keyword:

    function() {
        return 42;
    }

You can use a variable to assign a value to it and return the value:

    function() {
        var a = 42;

        return a;
    }

If you are not sure what values you are getting, try to log them (check the API tab for a description
of all available API functions):

    function(a) {
        log("a = " + a);
    }
