Peter and JÃ¼rgen were on vacation in Austria. For a whole week
they were hiking and climbing mountains. Back at home, after 
taking care of their blisters, they were puzzled by a simple 
question: what was the highest difference in altitude they were 
climbing upwards.

At least they have a lot of data from an old GPS device. This 
data basically consists of altitude differences it collected 
in a regular manner. But how should they calculate the correct 
answer?

**An example:**

The log consists of following values: 

310 ft, -410 ft, **590 ft**, 260 ft, -530 ft, 580 ft, **970 ft**, -930 ft, -230 ft, 840 ft.

In this example, the maximum altitude difference occured between the values **590 ft** and **970 ft**. The result in this case is **1870 ft**.

Unfortunately the GPS device collected an incredible amount of values, way too much to calculate it manually.

**Can you help them to find the correct answer?**
