Peter was on vacation in Austria (the one with the mountains, not the one with the kangaroos). For a whole week he was hiking and climing mountains. Back at home, after taking care of his blisters, he wants to know what was the highest difference in altitude he was climbing upwards. He has a lot of data from his old GPS device. This data basically consists of altitude differences it collected in a regular manner. 

For example:

The log consists of following values: 31 ft, -41 ft, 59 ft, 26 ft, -53 ft, 58 ft, 97 ft, -93 ft, -23 ft, 84 ft. In this example, the maximum altitude difference happend between the values "59 ft" and "97 tf". The result in this case is 187 ft.

Unfortunately the GPS device collected an incredible amount of values, way too much to calculate it by hand. Can you help him to find the right answer?
