You have ten bags each with 10 coins in them. Each coin weighs 10 gram. The bags are numbered from one to ten.
But one bag contains bad money. The coins in this bag look exactly like the real ones, but they only weight 9 gram each.

I think you can imagine what comes next. You have to find the bag with the bad coins.
All you've got is a scale that shows you the exact weight of everything you put on it.

You might think thats easy. I simply weigh each bag and the lightest one is the bad one.
But there is a little restriction. You have to find the bad coins with only ***one*** weighting.
You can take the coins out of the bags and weight them. But if the scale shows you a weight, you have to tell us the number of
the bag.
