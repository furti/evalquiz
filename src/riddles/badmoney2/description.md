After the last riddle you are left with a broken weighting scale and a bag with good and bad coins. 

Remember, good coins weight 10 gram each, the bad ones weight 9 gram. They all look exactly the same.

You already managed to figure out most of the bad coins, but you still have 27 coins left. You know that exactly one coin is a fake one, but you only have an old pendulum balance scale from your grandmother without any weights. Can you find the bad coin?
