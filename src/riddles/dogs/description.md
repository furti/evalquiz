You are out for a walk with both of your dogs: 
one of the dogs is big and fast, the other is 
small and slow.

Both dogs decide to run to their favourite tree. 

**The big one is exactly twice as fast as the slow 
one.**

The dogs start at the same time. When the fast dog 
reaches the tree, he turns around and runs back 
to the slow dog. Then he runs back to the tree 
and so forth.

Can you **calculate the distance your fast dog 
travels** while running back and forth between 
the tree and the slow dog?
