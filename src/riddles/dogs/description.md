You are out for a walk with both of your dogs. Both dogs decide to run to their favourite tree.
You have a big, massy and a small dog. The small one has double the speed of the big one.

Both start at the same time to run to the tree. When the small dog reaches the tree he turns around and
runs back to the big dog. Then he runs back to the tree and so forth.

Could you calculate the distance your small dog traveled while running back and forth between the tree and your big dog?
