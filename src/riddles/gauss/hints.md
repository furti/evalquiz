You can use a variable to assign a value to it and return the value:

    function() {
        var a = 42;

        return a;
    }

One solution to solve this riddle is to write a loop:

    function() {
        for (var i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ...
        }
    }

But Carly is really good at math. You may need a better solution.
